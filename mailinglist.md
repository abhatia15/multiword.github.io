### Mailing list

The Section keeps a mailing list for announcements and discussions on topics related to multiword expressions and computational linguistics. After [joining the Section](organization/members), members are subscribed to the mailing list (except if they opt out).

The mailing list is the official channel to communicate with all members. News on the yearly MWE workshop series and announcements for elections and standing committee nominations are posted on the list. Members can post freely whereas posts by non members are moderated by the Section representative. 

  * Post a message using the [Google Groups interface](https://groups.google.com/g/siglex-mwe-members) or
  * Send an email directly to [siglex-mwe-members@googlegroups.com](mailto:siglex-mwe-members@googlegroups.com)
