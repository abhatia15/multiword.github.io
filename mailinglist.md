### Mailing list

The Section keeps a mailing list for announcements and discussions on topics related to multiword expressions and computational linguistics. After [joining the Section](organization/members), members are subscribed to the mailing list (except if they opt out).

The mailing list is the official channel to communicate with all members. News on the yearly MWE workshop series and announcements for elections and standing committee nominations are posted on the list. The list is moderated by the Section's standing committee. All messages related to computational linguistics research and abiding by the [ACL anti-harassment policy](https://www.aclweb.org/adminwiki/index.php?title=Anti-Harassment_Policy) will be posted.

  * Post a message using the [Google Groups interface](https://groups.google.com/g/siglex-mwe-members) or
  * Send an email directly to [siglex-mwe-members@googlegroups.com](mailto:siglex-mwe-members@googlegroups.com)
  
If you would like to be removed from the mailing list, please send a request to [siglex-mwe-board@googlegroups.com](mailto:siglex-mwe-board@googlegroups.com).

The 2008-2021 archive of our [historical multiword-expressions mailing list](https://sourceforge.net/p/multiword/mailman/multiword-expressions/) on SourceForge is still available, but the list has been closed on March 2021. The current list has no web archive.
