### <a name="keynotes"> Keynote Speakers </a>
This year, we are going to have two amazing talks by:

[Sabine Schulte im Walde](http://www.schulteimwalde.de), University of Stuttgart
<ul>
<li> <b>Title:</b> Figurative Language in Noun Compound Models across Target Properties, Domains and Time </li>
<li> <b>Abstract:</b> A variety of distributional and multi-modal computational approaches has been suggested for modelling the degrees of compositionality across types of multiword expressions and languages. As the starting point of my talk, I will present standard variants of computational models that have been proven successful in predicting the compositionality of German and English noun compounds. The main part of the talk will then be concerned with investigating the general reliability of these standard models and discussing implications for gold-standard datasets: I will demonstrate how prediction results vary (i) across representations, (ii) across empirical target properties, (iii) across compound types, (iv) across levels of abstractness, and (v) for general- vs. domain-specific language. Finally, I will present a preliminary quantitative study on diachronic changes of noun compound meanings and compositionality over time. </li>
<li> <b>Bio:</b> Sabine Schulte im Walde is an Associate Professor at the Institute for Natural Language Processing at the University of Stuttgart. She studied Computational Linguistics and Cognitive Science at the Universities of Stuttgart and Edinburgh, received a PhD in Computational Linguistics in 2003 from the University of Stuttgart, and the Venia Legendi (Habilitation) from Saarland University in 2009. From 2003-2004 she was a member of the Language Technology Group at the lexicographer DUDEN in Mannheim. In the past 10 years, Sabine has been the Principal Investigator of several research projects from the German Research Foundation (DFG), she was a Director of the Integrated Research Training Group for doctoral students in the DFG Collaborative Research Centre 732, and from 2011-2016 she was a DFG Heisenberg Fellow.

The topics of her research include synchronic and diachronic language variation and ambiguity; figurative languge usage in multiword expressions and metaphors; the creation of datasets with human judgements on meaning components and meaning relatedness; and the application of models to lexicography, machine translation, and terminology extraction.</li>
</ul>

[Steven Bird](http://www.stevenbird.net), Charles Darwin University
<ul>
<li> <b>Title:</b> Multiword Expressions and the Low-Resource Scenario from the Perspective of a Local Oral Culture </li>
<li> <b>Abstract:</b> Research on multiword expressions and on under-resourced languages often begins with problematisation. The existence of non-compositional meaning, or the paucity of conventional language resources, are treated as problems to be solved. This perspective is associated with the view of Language as a lexico-grammatical code, and of NLP as a conventional sequence of computational tasks. In this talk, I share from my experience in an Australian Aboriginal community, where people tend to see language as an expression of identity and of ‘connection to country’. Here, my early attempts to collect language data were thwarted. There was no obvious role for tasks like speech recognition, parsing, or translation. Instead, working under the authority of local elders, I pivoted to language processing tasks that were more in keeping with local interests and aspirations. I describe these tasks and suggest some new ways of framing the work of NLP, and I explore implications for work on multiword expressions and on under-resourced languages. </li>
<li> <b>Bio:</b> Steven Bird is conducting social and technological experiments in the future evolution of the world's languages. Together with his students and colleagues, he is developing scalable methods for preserving disappearing words and worldviews for future generations of speakers and scholars. He is collaborating with speech communities in diasporas and ancestral homelands to design new approaches to language maintenance and revitalisation.

Steven studied computer science at the University of Melbourne before completing a PhD in computational linguistics at the University of Edinburgh. He has conducted fieldwork on endangered languages in West Africa, South America, Central Asia, Melanesia, and Australia. He has held academic positions at the Universities of Edinburgh, Pennsylvania, Melbourne, and UC Berkeley. He holds a secondary appointment as Senior Research Scientist at the International Computer Science Institute, UC Berkeley. He serves as Linguist at the Nawarddeken Academy in West Arnhem.

Steven is leading the Top End Language Lab. </li>
<li> <b>Note:</b> This talk is scheduled for the MWE+SIGUL Joint Session. </li>

### <a name="description"> Description </a>

Multiword expressions (MWEs) are word combinations which exhibit lexical, syntactic, semantic, pragmatic and/or statistical idiosyncrasies ([Baldwin &amp; Kim 2010](https://people.eng.unimelb.edu.au/tbaldwin/pubs/handbook2009.pdf)), such as by and large, hot dog, pay a visit and pull one's leg. The notion encompasses closely related phenomena: idioms, compounds, light-verb constructions, phrasal verbs, rhetorical figures, collocations, institutionalised phrases, etc. Their behaviour is often unpredictable; for example, their meaning often does not result from the direct combination of the meanings of their parts. Given their irregular nature, MWEs often pose complex problems in linguistic modelling (e.g. annotation), NLP tasks (e.g. parsing), and end-user applications (e.g. natural language understanding and MT), hence still representing an open issue for computational linguistics ([Constant et al. 2017](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/J17-4005/)).

For almost two decades, modelling and processing MWEs for NLP has been the topic of the MWE workshop organised by the [MWE section](https://multiword.org/) of [SIGLEX](http://www.siglex.org/) in conjunction with major NLP conferences since 2003. Impressive progress has been made in the field, but our understanding of MWEs still requires much research considering its need and usefulness in NLP applications. For this 18th edition of the workshop, we identified three topics on which contributions are particularly encouraged:

- **MWE processing in low-resource languages:** The PARSEME shared tasks ([Ramisch et al. 2020](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.mwe-1.14/); [Ramisch et al. 2018](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W18-4925/); [Savary et al. 2017](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W17-1704/)), among others, have fostered significant progress in MWE identification, providing datasets that include low-resource languages, evaluation measures and tools that now allow fully integrating MWE identification into end-user applications. A few efforts have recently explored methods for automatic interpretation of MWEs ([Bhatia et al. 2018](https://library.oapen.org/bitstream/handle/20.500.12657/27391/1002619.pdf?sequence=1#page=79); [Bhatia et al. 2017](https://aclanthology.org/W17-1719.pdf)). Pursuing similar efforts on understanding MWEs in low-resource languages is beneficial. there are some recent efforts on processing of MWEs in low-resource languages ([Liu & Wang 2020](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9310506); [Kumar et al. 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050917314035); [Wei et al. 2015](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7451522?section=abstract)). Resource creation and sharing should be pursued in parallel to the development of methods able to capitalize on small datasets.
- **MWE identification and interpretation in pre-trained language models:** Most current MWE processing is limited to their identification and detection using pre-trained language models (Taslimipoor et al. 2020), but we lack understanding about how MWEs are represented and dealt with therein ([Nedumpozhimana & Kelleher 2021](https://aclanthology.org/2021.mwe-1.7.pdf); [Garcia et al. 2021](https://aclanthology.org/2021.eacl-main.310.pdf), [Fakharian & Cook 2021](https://aclanthology.org/2021.mwe-1.4/)). Now that NLP has shifted towards end-to-end neural models like BERT, capable of solving complex end-user tasks with little or no intermediary linguistic symbols, questions arise about the extent to which MWEs should be implicitly or explicitly modelled in such models (Shwartz and Dagan 2019).
- **MWE processing to enhance end-user applications:** As underlined by the MWE 2021 call for papers, MWEs gained particular attention in end-user applications, including MT ([Zaninello &amp; Birch 2020](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.lrec-1.471/)), simplification ([Kochmar et al. 2020](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.lrec-1.545/), [Liu &amp; Hwa 2016](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/N16-1040/)), language learning and assessment ([Paquot et al. 2019](https://dial.uclouvain.be/pr/boreal/object/boreal:226339), [Christiansen &amp; Arnon 2017](https://doi.org/10.1111/tops.12274)), social media mining ([Maisto et al. 2017](https://doi.org/10.4000/books.aaccademia.2441)), and abusive language detection ([Zampieri et al. 2020](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.semeval-1.188/), [Caselli et al. 2020](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.lrec-1.760/)). We believe that it is crucial to extend and deepen these first attempts to integrate and evaluate MWE technology in these and further end-user applications.

Through this workshop, we would like to bring together and encourage researchers in various NLP subfields to submit MWE-related research, so that approaches that deal with processing of MWEs including processing for low-resource languages and for various applications can benefit from each other. We also intend to consolidate the converging effects of previous joint workshops [LAW-MWE-CxG 2018](http://multiword.sourceforge.net/lawmwecxg2018/), [MWE-WN 2019](http://multiword.sourceforge.net/mwewn2019/) and [MWE-LEX 2020](http://multiword.sourceforge.net/mwelex2020/), and the [joint MWE-WOAH panel in 2021](https://multiword.org/mwe2021/#program), extending our scope to MWEs in e-lexicons and WordNets, MWE annotation, as well as grammatical constructions. Correspondingly, we will call for papers on research related (but not limited) to MWEs and constructions in:
- Computationally-applicable theoretical work in psycholinguistics and corpus linguistics
- Annotation and representation in resources such as corpora, treebanks, e-lexicons, and WordNets
- Processing in syntactic and semantic frameworks (e.g. CCG, CxG, HPSG, LFG, TAG, UD, etc.)
- Discovery and identification methods
- Interpretation of MWEs and understanding of text containing them
- Language acquisition, language learning, and non-standard language (e.g. tweets, speech)
- Evaluation of annotation and processing techniques
- Retrospective comparative analyses from the PARSEME shared tasks
- Processing for end-user applications (e.g. MT, NLU, summarisation, language learning, etc.)
- Implicit and explicit representation in pre-trained language models and end-user applications
- Evaluation and probing of pre-trained language models and end-user applications
- Resources and tools (e.g. lexicons, identifiers) and their integration into end-user applications
- Theoretical and computational linguistic description and modelling in low-resource languages
- Annotation guidelines and methods in low-resource languages (expert, crowdsourcing, automatic)
- Adaptation and transfer of annotations and related resources to low-resource languages
- Processing in low-resource languages (supervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised methods for identification, discovery, and interpretation)
- Evaluation of annotations and processing techniques for low-resource languages
- Processing for end-user applications in low-resource languages

Pursuing its efforts in building bridges with other communities, the MWE Section organises a joint session with the [workshop of the Special Interest Group on Under-resourced Languages (SIGUL 2022)](https://sigul-2022.ilc.cnr.it/). The goal is to foster future synergies that could address scientific challenges in the creation of resources, models and applications to deal with multiword expressions and related phenomena in low-resource scenarios, in accordance with one of our special topics in MWE 2022. The session will feature a joint poster session and a joint keynote talk by Steven Bird.


<!-- Version in the initial website/call for papers -->
<!--The MWE Section would like to pursue its efforts in building bridges with other communities. We intend to organise a joint session with the workshop of the [Special Interest Group on Under-resourced Languages](http://www.elra.info/en/sig/sigul/), SIGUL 2022, which proposal was also submitted to be co-located with LREC 2022. The goal is to foster future synergies that could address scientific challenges in the creation of resources, models and applications to deal with multiword expressions and related phenomena in low-resource scenarios, in accordance with one of our special topics in MWE 2022.  The session format is currently under discussion. This would require some overlap between the schedules of both workshops, implying synchronisation as to whether both of them take place before or after LREC 2022.-->

### <a name="submission"> Submission modalities </a>
The workshop invites two types of submissions:
- **Archival submissions** present substantially original research. Submissions will follow the [LREC stylesheet](https://lrec2022.lrec-conf.org/en/submission2022/authors-kit/). They can be long papers (8 content pages + references) or short papers (4 content pages + references). The decisions as to oral or poster presentations will be taken by the PC chairs, with no distinction in the proceedings. Submission will be **double-blind**.
- **Non-archival submissions** of abstracts will also be considered for presentation, but not included in the proceedings. They can be abstracts describing preliminary results, work in progress, or ongoing projects or abstracts of papers recently submitted or published at other venues (conferences, journals, book chapters). Abstracts are not anonymous and will go through a light reviewing process.

All papers should be submitted via the workshop's START submission space. Please choose the appropriate link for standard [Archival submission](https://www.softconf.com/lrec2022/MWE/user/scmd.cgi?scmd=submitPaperCustom&pageid=0) or for the [Non-archival submission](https://www.softconf.com/lrec2022/MWE/user/scmd.cgi?scmd=submitPaperCustom&pageid=1). Registering to the workshop will be necessary to present both archival and non-archival submissions. Presentation and participation formats (on-line, on-site, both) will depend on LREC 2022 main conference arrangements and will be announced later.

### <a name="instructions"> Instructions for authors </a>

The **double-blind** submissions (Archival submissions) should adhere to the [ACL Author Guidelines](https://www.aclweb.org/adminwiki/index.php?title=ACL_Author_Guidelines). There is no limit on the number of reference pages.

The [PMWE book series](https://langsci-press.org/catalog/series/pmwe) editors have put forward a list of conventions to [cite multilingual MWE examples](https://gitlab.com/parseme/pmwe/-/blob/master/Conventions-for-MWE-examples/PMWE_series_conventions_for_multilingual_examples.pdf) and a [checklist for PMWE authors](https://gitlab.com/parseme/pmwe/-/wikis/Checklist%20for%20authors%20and%20volume%20editors). Parts of the checklist are specific to PMWE authors, but sections like _Terms, abbreviations and spelling_ can be relevant for MWE 2022 submissions. We encourage authors to adopt these conventions whenever relevant, without enforcing them. We hope that, in the long term, these could become widely adopted standards in the community.

All submissions should be made via the workshop's START space. Please choose the appropriate submission modality as described in the Sumbission modalities section above.
