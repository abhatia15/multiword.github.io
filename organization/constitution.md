### SIGLEX-MWE Section Constitution

#### 1. Statement of Purpose

The **Multiword Expressions (MWE) Section** is a Section of the **Special Interest Group on the Lexicon (SIGLEX)** of the **Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL)**. The goals of the SIGLEX-MWE Section (henceforth referred to as the Section) are:

- To foster interest in topics related to *multiword expressions*.
- To provide to its members a means to communicate and announce information related to
recent research and developments on topics related to *multiword expressions*.
- To organize, support and announce events and initiatives such as meetings and
workshops on topics related to *multiword expressions*.

#### 2. Relation to SIGLEX

All activities of the Section are subject to the approval of the SIGLEX elected officers (henceforth referred to as the *SIGLEX board*). Unless specified differently in this constitution, the Section conforms to the [SIGLEX constitution](https://siglex.org/constitution.html).

#### 3. Membership

Membership is free and open to anyone interested in topics related to multiword expressions. Membership is obtained automatically by selecting the MWE section while registering to SIGLEX. A Section member must provide at least his/her full name, affiliation, scientific profile and an email address, which must be up-to-date. Membership can be terminated either according to the SIGLEX constitution or by the Section's Standing Committee upon a majority vote if a member does not comply with the current constitution or with the ACL anti-harassment policy.

#### 4. Standing Committee

The Standing Committee (SC) of the Section is composed of **five officers**:

- **The Section representative**, who is an **elected officer** and member of the SIGLEX board. The Section representative acts as the president of the SC. The election procedure and the duration of the term of the Section representative are defined, as for the other SIGLEX board officers, by the SIGLEX constitution.

- **Four nominated officers** selected by the SIGLEX board from a list proposed by the Section representative. The duration of the term of an SC nominated officer is 2 years. It is preferable to alternate term periods for different SC nominated officers, so as to ensure a transfer of competences within the SC. The incumbent and the outgoing SC nominated officers should be consulted by the Section representative for each new nomination. A nominated officer can serve several times in the SC, provided that there is a break of at least 2 years between two consecutive terms.

The SC officers must be members of the Section and have published research work in topics related to multiword expressions. Additionally, some criteria that could be used to nominate an officer can include geographical distribution balance, gender balance, scientific excellence, diversity and multilingualism.

#### 5. Standing Committee Duties

The duties of the SC are:

- To maintain and update the Section's website and mailing list.
- To chair or to nominate the chairs of the annual workshop on multiword expressions,
ensuring that at least half of the chairs are new between two consecutive editions of the workshop.
- To meet regularly to discuss and promote initiatives related to multiword expressions,
such as meetings, related workshops, shared tasks, tutorials, seminars and research projects.
- To answer any inquiries about the Section.
- To report yearly on the Section's activities to its members.
- To receive feedback and proposals from the Section members concerning the Section's activities.
- To yearly collect expressions of interest from candidates for the SC incoming members.

## 6. Changes to the constitution

A change to this constitution may be initiated by the Standing Committee or by any other group of 5 members of the Section. Applying the proposed change requires an approval of the SIGLEX board.
