### Members

Membership is **free of charge and open to anyone interested in multiword expressions**:

  * Join via the [SIGLEX registration form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfldnrynfsqwMu_xwI-c8nxajUUeALJd9INhEPcSb8zCD-GBQ/viewform?usp=sf_link)
  * Check the [list of members](https://siglex.org/members.html) - look for _MWE_ in column _Sections_
  
Joining the MWE section implies joining SIGLEX; it does not require [ACL](https://www.aclweb.org/) membership. Section members can vote in the [SIGLEX board](https://siglex.org/constitution.html) elections and be nominated to the section's [standing committee](standingcommittee). Members are automatically added to the [mailing list](../mailinglist) (except if they opt out).
