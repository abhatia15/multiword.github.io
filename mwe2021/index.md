### <a name="description"> Description </a>

Multiword expressions (MWEs) are word combinations which exhibit lexical, syntactic, semantic, pragmatic and/or statistical idiosyncrasies ([Baldwin &amp; Kim 2010](https://people.eng.unimelb.edu.au/tbaldwin/pubs/handbook2009.pdf)), such as _by and large_, _hot dog_, _pay a visit_ and _pull one&#39;s leg_. The notion encompasses closely related phenomena: idioms, compounds, light-verb constructions, rhetorical figures, institutionalised phrases, collocations, etc. The behaviour of MWEs is often unpredictable, in particular their meanings are not regularly composed of the meanings of their parts. Thus, MWEs are a major challenge in computational linguistics ([Constant et al. 2017](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/J17-4005/)), including linguistic modelling (e.g. treebanking), computational modelling (e.g. parsing), and end-user NLP applications (e.g. natural language understanding, machine translation, and social media mining).

Modelling and processing MWEs for NLP has been the topic of the MWE workshop organised by the [MWE section](http://multiword.sourceforge.net/) of [SIGLEX](http://www.siglex.org/) in conjunction with major NLP conferences since 2003. Although much progress has been made in the field, MWE processing in end-user NLP tasks is currently under-explored, and most studies still introduce MWEs as future work. Nonetheless, there are recent studies in which MWEs gained particular attention in end-user applications, including machine translation ([Zaninello &amp; Birch 2020](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.lrec-1.471/)), text simplification ([Kochmar et al. 2020](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.lrec-1.545/), [Liu &amp; Hwa 2016](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/N16-1040/)), language learning and assessment ([Paquot et al. 2019](https://dial.uclouvain.be/pr/boreal/object/boreal:226339), [Christiansen &amp; Arnon 2017](https://doi.org/10.1111/tops.12274)), social media mining ([Maisto et al. 2017](https://doi.org/10.4000/books.aaccademia.2441)), and abusive language detection ([Zampieri et al. 2020](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.semeval-1.188/), [Caselli et al. 2020](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.lrec-1.760/)).

The special focus for this 17th edition of the workshop is on **MWE processing in end-user applications** such as those listed above. On the one hand, the PARSEME shared tasks ([Ramisch et al. 2020](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.mwe-1.14/), [Ramisch et al. 2018](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W18-4925/), [Savary et al. 2017](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W17-1704/)), among others, fostered significant progress in MWE identification, providing datasets, evaluation measures and tools that now allow fully integrating MWE identification into end-user applications. On the other hand, NLP seems to be shifting towards end-to-end neural models capable of solving complex end-user tasks with little or no intermediary linguistic symbols, questioning the extent to which MWEs should be implicitly or explicitly modelled. Therefore, one goal of this workshop is to bring together and encourage researchers in various NLP subfields to submit MWE-related research, so that approaches that deal with MWEs in various applications could benefit from each other.

Following the success of previous joint workshops [LAW-MWE-CxG 2018](http://multiword.sourceforge.net/lawmwecxg2018/), [MWE-WN 2019](http://multiword.sourceforge.net/mwewn2019/) and [MWE-LEX 2020](http://multiword.sourceforge.net/mwelex2020/), we further extend the scope of the workshop to MWEs in e-lexicons and WordNets, MWE annotation, as well as grammatical constructions.

The 17th Workshop on MWEs invites submissions on (but not limited to) the following topics:

**Traditional MWE topics:**

- Computationally-applicable theoretical work on MWEs and constructions in psycholinguistics and corpus linguistics
- MWE and construction annotation and representation in resources such as corpora, treebanks, e-lexicons and WordNets
- Processing of MWEs and constructions in syntactic and semantic frameworks (e.g. CCG, CxG, HPSG, LFG, TAG, UD, etc.)
- Discovery and identification methods for MWEs and constructions
- MWEs and constructions in language acquisition, language learning, and non-standard language (e.g. tweets, speech)
- Evaluation of annotation and processing techniques for MWEs and constructions
- Retrospective comparative analyses from the PARSEME shared tasks on automatic identification of MWEs

**Topics on MWEs and end-user applications:**

- Processing of MWEs and constructions in end-user applications (e.g. MT, NLU, summarisation, social media mining, computer assisted language learning)
- Implicit and explicit representation of MWEs and constructions in end-user applications
- Evaluation of end-user applications concerning MWEs and constructions
- Resources and tools for MWEs and constructions (e.g. lexicons, identifiers) in end-user applications
