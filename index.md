### Welcome to SIGLEX-MWE section!

SIGLEX-MWE is a section of the [Special Interest Group on the Lexicon (SIGLEX)](http://www.siglex.org) of the [Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL)](http://www.aclweb.org/). It is dedicated to promoting scientific activity on **multiword expressions** (MWEs) in computational linguistics. Its main activity is the coordination of the [MWE workshop series](events/previousevents) and related events such as the PARSEME shared tasks.

Anyone interested in research in multiword expressions is welcome to **join the section** (free of charge) by filling in the form on the [SIGLEX members page](https://siglex.org/members.html).
